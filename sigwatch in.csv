NRDC translated press releases and other documents published by its South Korean equipment supplier, Sung Jin Geotec, which apparently suggest heavy haulage will continue long past the one year period announced by Imperial. NRDC has not published the documents on its website, through it has shared them with the Associated Press. Meanwhile Sierra Club is mobilising supporters in the region to write to their local papers claiming the transports will damage the tourist industry, threaten public safety and undermine the local ecosystem. <br /><em>SIGWatch comment: National NGOs opposed to oil sands have successfully mobilised local people and NGOs who resent disruption to their remote wilderness to join a campaign which if successful could cost Imperial millions of dollars.
